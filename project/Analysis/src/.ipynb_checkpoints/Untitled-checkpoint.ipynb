This is best achieved\\n   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.\\n   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)\\n\\n3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.\\n\\nOK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC\\nwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.\\n\\nI want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync\\npulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting\\nthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.\\n\\nThere are 2 reasons for doing this\\n\\n1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're\\n   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.\\n\\n2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the\\n   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my\\n   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,\\n   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.\\n   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA\\n   will cut things down to 2.

You might get slightly higher\\nthroughput with a SCSI disk, but you\\'ll also pay more for the disk\\n($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You\\'ll also pay much, much more for a\\ngood SCSI controller.\\n\\n     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they\\'re\\nused with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).\\nUnfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking\\noperating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is\\nmostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to\\nconnect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.\\nHowever, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.\\n\\n     If you\\'re only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.

Who knows what\\n  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]\\n\\n     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,\\nwhich probably don\\'t exist unless you\\'re using one of the \"better\"/\"high\\nperformance\" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI\\ncontrollers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and\\ndrivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular\\nname-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased\\n(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:\\n\\n* Adaptec\\'s EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI\\n  controllers.\\n\\n* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).\\n  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card\\n  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.\\n\\n     Central Point\\'s PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape\\ndrives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it\\nworks only with Adaptec controllers.\\n\\n> 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a\\n>     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar\\n>     equipment.\\n\\n     Yes, you will run into problems, if you\\'re using a\\nhigh-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn\\'t sound\\nright, doesn\\'t it?  It\\'s true, though.  With one of these controllers,\\nyou\\'ll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound\\ncards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and\\nWindows 3.1.  I know.  I\\'ve been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI\\ncontroller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape\\nbackups).  If you want a copy of my \"Adaptec 1542 hints and tips\" file,\\nsend email.\\n\\n     These problems aren\\'t really the fault of the SCSI controller card;\\nthe problems are really with the general hardware and software design of\\nthe PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card\\nis what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.\\n\\n     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC\\ncompatibility problems.  If you\\'re planning on using only MSDOS/Windows\\n3.1, stick with IDE.

Also I use\\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife\\'s use, and she \\nwon\\'t let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \\nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \\nused offline files.  \\n\\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly\\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don\\'t have time to mess around\\nwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the \\nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\\nhope can\\'t I, after all, I have work to do).\\n\\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \\nhardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the \\nupgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I\\nstill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) \\nfrom some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation\\ngoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I\\'m\\nallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a \"pure\" NT system.  Also, will \\nNT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently \\nhave stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite \\nDisk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the \\nsystem (It\\'s cramped now).\\n\\nI realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT \\nversion?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk\\nwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)\\na comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask \\nChili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I\\'d\\nrather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without\\nDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?\\n\\nAny feedback or advice (including \"forget NT\" with good reasons) is much\\nappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better\\nmultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up\\nthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),\\nand I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).

       " 'Organization: University of Illinois at Chicago, academic Computer Center\\nFrom: Pankaj Saxena <U09416@uicvm.uic.edu>\\nSubject: TCP/IP through Windows 3.1\\nLines: 52\\n\\nI don\\'t know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here\\'s my question:\\n\\nCONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the\\n         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my\\n         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it\\n         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone\\n         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that\\n         I type \"telnet uicvm\" or \"tn3270 uicvm\" (either will work) at the DOS\\n         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then\\n         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon\\n         screen. \"TELNET\" and \"TN3270\" are the names of batch files in my SLIP\\n         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the\\n         session.\\n\\nPROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I\\n         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I\\n         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that\\n         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me\\n         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to\\n         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)\\n         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP\\n         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP\\n         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-\\n         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when\\n         that didn\\'t work. For another, there were too many errors. It often\\n         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center\\n         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can\\'t keep going back to\\n         them with more questions.\\n\\nQUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows\\n         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too\\n         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that\\n         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost\\n         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:\\n\\n         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1\\n         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation\\n         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that\\'s the only kind the\\n            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp\\n            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I\\'m hazy about\\n            that.\\n\\n         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it\\'s a true\\n         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under\\n         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently\\n         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet\\n         session and other applications.\\n\\nAny information received is appreciated.\\n\\nPankaj Saxena\\nu09416@uicvm.uic.edu\\n',\n",

You\\n   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left\\n   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your \"left\\n   and right window\" as you can have as many open as you wish instead \\n   of just two.\\n\\n2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking\\n   on the executable\\'s icon.\\n\\n3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double\\n   clicking on the document file\\'s icon, provided you have\\n   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The\\n   \"browse\" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you\\n   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.\\n   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your\\n   requirement for \"text reading and graphics viewing\".\\n\\nI know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up\\nall the associations you need is the way to do it.\\n\\nIf Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be\\npretty good indeed!

ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\\n------------------------------------------------\\nPostal Address:\\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\\nFax: (408) 991-3773\\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\\n\\n\",\n",

In general, if\\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\\n\\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\\ncan too.\\n\\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right.

Specifically, a comparison between the\\nCanon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people\\nasked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I\\nreceived.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have\\nnot deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so\\nyou can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an\\nunbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests\\nfavoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you\\nbelieve unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a\\nwide range of comments, each has its own value.  \\n\\nThere was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its\\nprice/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability\\nof the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid\\nbackground).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new\\nprinter to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around\\nsummertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first\\ninkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of\\nre-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely\\ndepends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop\\naround first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your\\nprinter).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will\\nprint, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets\\n(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,\\nthat\\'s a brief research summary of my personal research.

Performance isn\\'t spectacular under Windows using\\nTrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for\\nthe HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on \\'standard\\' photo-copy\\npaper the characters have slightly \\'frayed\\' edges but on better quality\\n\\'distinction\\' type paper things look better. For most applications I find\\ncopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows\\ndriver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few\\n\\'intelli-fonts\\'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType\\nbut haven\\'t really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless\\nthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn\\'t bother. The RAM cartridges\\ncan\\'t be used as buffer - soft fonts only.\\n\\nFor graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via\\nthe HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as\\n\\'scatter\\', \\'pattern\\' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on\\nthe type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem\\narises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The\\nrange of tones for graphic images isn\\'t brilliant but I think that is more\\nof a limitation with inkjet printers in general.\\n\\n>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.\\n\\nHowever, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from\\nEpson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing\\nlaser-like quality on normal copier paper.

Normal copy paper works great with it, you\\ncan only tell it\\'s not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve\\ninches from your face.  (That is, if you\\'re nearsighted, like me! :) ) The\\nprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other\\ncomplaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for\\nthose archaic software packages that haven\\'t written a driver for it yet.\\nThe teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it\\nbetween now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine\\nfrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend\\nwho has the HP you are looking at.

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality\\nare similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet\\nfor home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support\\nin so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM\\nProprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be\\nthe case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use\\ncut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit\\ncheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.\\n\\n  Just my $0.02 worth..\\n\\n-- \\nMike Mattix\\nAgricultural Group of Monsanto\\nP.O. Box 174\\nLuling, LA 70070\\nINTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\n  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not\\npresent a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the\\ntranslation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the\\nnote.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around\\nthe paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics\\nresolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:\\nWordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and\\ncould not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers\\ngives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer\\nhence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.\\nI had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no\\ncomparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration\\nthe Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.\\n\\nI went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I\\nspent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at\\nwork this month anyway.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nMike Mattix\\nAg Group of Monsanto\\nLuling, LA\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nI spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet\\nBJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:\\n\\n1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon\\n2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference\\n3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.\\n\\nThe BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the\\nBJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.\\n\\nAs you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven\\'t done anything\\nbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I\\nknow that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the\\nprinter, but I don\\'t know how it compares (also the driver included with\\nthe printer is Canon\\'s whereas I don\\'t know where the Microsoft BBS one\\ncomes from - Microsoft?)\\n\\nHope this helps.\\n-- \\nThomas V.

I\\'ve been\\nunusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I\\'ve done this a\\nfew times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.\\n\\nI can\\'t remember much about the process except that I read about three\\nreviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I\\nbought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build\\na multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner\\ntowards that).  Although I haven\\'s used the colour thing in earnest yet I\\ntried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the\\nresult.\\n\\nI note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour\\nand mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still\\nreadily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my\\nviews/experience:\\n\\n\\t1.\\tI don\\'t know anything about the Canon except that I came away\\n\\t\\tfrom reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with\\n\\t\\tthe idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.\\n\\n\\t2.\\tI believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the\\n\\t\\tideal place to be but the market\\'s still young so one assumes\\n\\t\\tthey have the expertise.\\n\\n\\t3.\\tThe 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly\\n\\t\\tacceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from\\n\\t\\tWindows.\\n\\n\\t4.\\tI used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured\\n\\t\\ttypesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)\\n\\t\\tand I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is\\n\\t\\tpretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...\\n\\n\\t5.\\tThe HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.\\n\\n\\t6.\\tIf you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it\\'s pretty\\n\\t\\tslow with it, God knows what it\\'s like without!\\n\\nI actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it\\'s not in daily\\nuse.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and\\nhaving a really dumb problem at the start it\\'s easy peasy to operate.\\n\\nHope this is of use.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nDavid\\t\\n\\n===========================================================================\\n\\nJust bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn\\'t be beat ($329, with\\n$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the\\nDeskJet in print quality.\\n\\nSpeed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don\\'t have figures).\\n         I don\\'t print long docs, though.\\n\\nQuality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is\\n         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up\\n         close; you can see a lot more \"jaggies\" than on a LaserJet.\\n         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the\\n         page/print head in place, I would imagine.\\n\\nLarge docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...\\n         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven\\'t tried it.\\n\\nDrivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.

(What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to\\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\\n    pixels.\\n\\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\\n    If\\tyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\\n    swap all short and long integer values.\\n\\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension \".BMP\".   This  is  because\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 2 -\\n\\n\\n    they  are  a  super-set of earlier \"bitmap image files\".  Consequently you\\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files.\\n\\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three \"flavors\"  of  DIB\\n    images:\\n\\t o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended\\t convention,  and  the\\n\\t     form  which I will describe how to create.\\t They are intended for\\n\\t     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\\n\\t o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the\\tflavor\\n\\t     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\\n\\t o   Old-style Bitmap images.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 3 -\\n\\n\\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\\n\\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\t as  a\\n\\t     DIB  file.\\t  This\\theader\\talso gives the total size of the image\\n\\t     file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.  A \"BITMAPINFOHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,\\n\\t     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\\n\\t     RGBQUAD structure.\\n\\t 4.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  The same \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\n\\t     as\\t a  DIB\\t file.\\t This  header also gives the total size of the\\n\\t     image file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.  A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this\\n\\t     exists  it\\t may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a\\n\\t     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.\\n\\t 4.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:\\n\\t 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.\\t Which\\theader\\n\\t     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.\\n\\t 2.  An optional color palette.\\t  This\\tpalette\\t may  be  composed  of\\n\\t     either   Windows\\tRGBQUAD\\t  structures  (if  the\\theader\\twas  a\\n\\t     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the\\theader\\n\\t     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).\\n\\t 3.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.\\n\\n    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward\\tsteps.\\n    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header\\n    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  \"windows.h\"\\tinclude\\t file.\\n    Palette  information  needs\\t to  be\\t stored for images that are not 24-bit\\n    images.  The five general steps are:\\n\\t 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER\\t  and\\tthe   BITMAPINFOHEADER\\n\\t     structures the basic image information.\\n\\t 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,\\t creating  the\\n\\t     color palette of RGBQUADS.\\n\\t 3.

On an intel byte ordered\\n    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed\\tin  C  as  the\\n    quantity (\\'M\\' << 8 | \\'B\\') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.\\n\\n    The \"bfSize\" field is the total size of the file.  For our\\tpurposes  this\\n    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the\\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the\\t color\\tpalette\\t times\\n    the\\t size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.\\tIf the\\n    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be\\n    calculated\\tahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in\\n    later.\\n\\n    Both the \"bfReserved1\" and the \"bfReserved2\"  fields  are  always  set  to\\n    zero.\\n\\n    The \"bfOffBits\" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data\\n    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set\\n    to:\\t the  size  of\\tthe   BITMAPFILEHEADER,\\t  plus\\t the   size   of   the\\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times\\n    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written\\n    write after the color palette if one exists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 6 -\\n\\n\\n    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER\\n\\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biSize;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biWidth;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biHeight;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t biPlanes;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t biBitCount;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biCompression;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biSizeImage;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biXPelsPerMeter;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biYPelsPerMeter;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biClrUsed;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biClrImportant;\\n\\t } BITMAPINFOHEADER;\\n\\n    The \"biSize\" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure\\n    itself.   When  reading  the  image\\t file,\\tthis  value is what is used to\\n    determine  that  the  image\\t contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER\\t and   not   a\\n    BITMAPCOREHEADER.\\n\\n    The \"biWidth\" field is the width of the image in image pixels.\\n\\n    The \"biHeight\" field is the height of the image in image lines.\\n\\n    The \"biPlanes\" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out\\n    as if there was one color plane.\\n\\n    The \"biBitCount\" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either\\n    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.\\n\\n    The \"biCompression\" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is\\n    compressed.\\t   DIB\\timages\\tsupport\\t two  forms  of\\t run-length  encoding.\\n    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don\\'t know yet how\\n    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the\\n    data is not compressed.\\n\\n    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to\\n    zero.   A  requirement  of\\tthe  interpretting software that it be able to\\n    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.\\n\\n    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be \"biClrUsed\".\\n    For\\t 4-bit\\tand  8-bit  images  this  field\\t indicates that not all of the\\n    possible color entries are used and that the  image\\t contains  \"biClrUsed\"\\n    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may\\n    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set\\n    this field to zero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 7 -\\n\\n\\n    COLOR PALETTES\\n\\n    Each entry of a  color  palette  is\\t a  RGBQUAD  structure.\\t  The  RGBQUAD\\n    structure is defined in the \"windows.h\" include file as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbBlue;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbGreen;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbRed;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbReserved;\\n\\t } RGBQUAD;\\n    The \"rgbReserved\" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the\\tamount\\n    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is\\n    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  \"rgbBlue\",  \"rgbGreen\",  or\\n    \"rgbRed\"   fields  indicates  that\\tthat  particular  component  does  not\\n    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in\\tany  of\\t these\\n    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully\\t to  the color\\n    composition.\\n\\n\\n\\n    IMAGE DATA\\n\\n    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data\\tin  DIB\\t image\\n    file.   The\\t creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and\\n    certainly was.\\n\\n    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four\\n    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\t---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\\n    The\\t bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\\n    first line of image data in the file.\\n\\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written\\tas  you\\t would\\n    expect.   One  bit\\timages\\tare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be\\t written  out  in  the\\n    order  blue,  green, red.

This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit\\nprocessor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s\\nPentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions\\nper clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola\\nis expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two\\nconfigurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50\\nSPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance\\nfor the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89\\nperformance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down\\nversion of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000\\nworkstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip\\nwith protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus\\nbuilt in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the\\nMicro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop\\nPowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,\\nincluding ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source\\nnoted.\\n\\nAccording to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has\\nbeen extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive\\narchitecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million\\ntransistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to\\nbe priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s\\n486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one\\nsource said.\\n\\n==== END REPOST ====\\n\",\n",

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\\nthe video circuitry \\'loses\\' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it\\'s\\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\\npreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:\\n-swapping the RAM\\n-swapping the VRAM\\n-swapping monitors (3 different 13\" Apple RGB and 2 16\" Apple RGB)\\n-swapping cables\\n-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy\\n-sacrificing various small mammals\\nHere are some other facts:\\n-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed\\n (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)\\n-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards\\n that exhibit it in our lab\\n-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards\\n that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as\\n faulty according to us.\\nHere are some speculations:\\n-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that\\n much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do\\n with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can\\n reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).\\n-the vendor\\'s representative blames \\'metal in your walls\\' - claims that our\\n walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac\\'s operation. We\\n have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it\\'s not in\\n the exact same spot....) Please don\\'t tell me this is probably it, I do\\n not want to believe it.\\n-it\\'s probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past\\n security at the entrance to our site.\\n\\nHas anyone any ideas?

Multiple graphs (of the same or\\n  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\\n  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\\n  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\\n  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\\n  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\\n  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\\n  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\\n  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\\n  \\n  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\\n  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\\n  \\n  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\\n  \\n  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\\n  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\\n  \\n  Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\\n==========================================================\\n\\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\\n======================\\n\\nIMDISP\\n------\\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\\n  [PC and Macs]\\n\\nLabVIEW 2\\n---------\\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been\\n  developed by Spyglass.\\n\\n  Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000\\n  fax: 217 355 8925\\n\\nNIH IMAGE\\n---------\\n  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)\\n  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.\\n  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,\\n  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting\\n  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\\n\\nPhotoMac\\n--------\\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\\n\\nPhotoPress\\n----------\\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\\n\\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\\n------------------------\\n  \"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

It is easily\\n  extensible through \"script\" (or indirect command) files. These script\\n  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are\\n  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.\\n  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame\\n  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides\\n  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\"\\n\\n  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200\\n\\nSatellite Image Workshop\\n------------------------\\n  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all\\n  sorts of image enhancing on it. You\\'ll need at least a Mac II with co-\\n  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn\\'t\\n  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1\\n\\n  In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet\\n  Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109\\n  (818) 354-6980\\n\\nVisualization Workbench\\n-----------------------\\n  \"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image\\n  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\"\\n\\n  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112\\n\\nAdobe Photoshop\\n---------------\\n\\n  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey\\n  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\\n  hues, color range and mask.\\n\\nImageStudio: Don\\'t know...\\n\\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\\n\\nDapple Systems\\n--------------\\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\\n\\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\\n\\nDigital Darkroom\\n----------------\\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\\n\\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that\\nit is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.\\n\\nThe annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful\\noptions, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that\\nrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently\\nin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on\\nall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared\\nto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --\\nagain, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored\\nby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also\\nnote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably\\ncompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that\\nnone of the FAX formats are really useful.\\n\\nWhat's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,\\ne.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have\\nprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses\\nbytes rather than pixels.\\n\\nBut the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register\\nproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.\\nThis means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably\\nread all incoming TIFF files.

I\\'m intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or\\n: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)\\n\\nI do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation\\nfor ANY package is to follow each one\\'s instructions for making the null-\\nmodem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn\\'t\\nreally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial\\nI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,\\nbut you should still check your software!\\n\\nI will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is\\na commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a\\nmodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications\\nhardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA\\nCommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the\\nconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is\\na \"DB-25\" but IBM has set an alternative \"standard\" of DB-9.  The primary\\nsignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).\\nThere are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.\\nFor example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate\\nin communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an\\noutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that\\nit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)\\nsignal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that\\'s\\nfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)\\nsignal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used\\nto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok\\nvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input\\nto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)\\nare Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs\\nto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -\\na signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection\\nto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.\\nDCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the \"connection\" has been established\\ni.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that\\'s it.  Oh\\nthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have\\nexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:\\n\\nName    DB-9     DB-25\\n SG       5        7\\n TD       3        2\\n RD       2        3\\nDTR       4       20\\nDSR       6        6\\nDCD       1        8\\nRTS       7        4\\nCTS       8        5\\n RI       9       22\\n\\nNow to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE\\nto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232\\nsignal definitions don\\'t work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert\\nthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these\\nsignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If\\nthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,\\nand crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other\\nend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send\\ndata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just\\nsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would\\ninclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the\\nsoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-\\nware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the\\nserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to\\nbe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-\\nLink or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The\\nonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also\\nfairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And\\nthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE\\'s are responsible for\\nflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn\\'t possible over-run the\\nDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the\\nDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast\\nto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by\\nasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can\\nsend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow\\ncontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,\\none common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no\\nwires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF\\ncommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware\\nflow control, but the problem is that you can\\'t send binary data because\\nyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol\\nsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract \"escape\"\\ncodes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-\\nware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to\\ndo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods\\nis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair\\ngame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.\\nBut I bet you\\'ll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with\\nall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,\\nI am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control\\nthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the\\nclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a\\ndiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling\\nstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS\\nsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-\\ning it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the\\nRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other\\npossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain\\nsignals that you don\\'t have (or don\\'t feel like providing because it would\\nmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting\\nthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like\\nthis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more\\n\"gotcha\" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to\\nsee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the\\nDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but\\nthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And\\nof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must\\npass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,\\nif any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not\\nspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use\\nthis one.\\n\\n    TD  ------  RD\\n    RD  ------  TD\\n    DTR ------ DSR\\n    DSR ------ DTR\\n    DCD ------ RTS-\\\\\\n  /-RTS ------ DCD |\\n  \\\\-CTS        CTS-/\\n\\n\\nGordon Lang\\n\\n',\n",

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\\n\\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations.

Generally what I do\\nis leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or\\nsyetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my\\noffice. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no\\nreason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being\\ndisplyed on the monitor\\'s tube.\\n\\n>Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.\\n\\n    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office\\nhas been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn\\'t had any\\nproblems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off\\nwhen I\\'m not actually working on the server itself.)\\n\\n-Hades\\n',\n",

XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\\n\\n>So, XV were designed\\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\n>program work -- design error.\\n\\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\\n\\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\\n\\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\n>major change to the original design.\\n\\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them.

It had _just_ gotten\\n\\tthe pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop\\n\\t(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).\\n\\t\\n\\tBlam.

Well, I can sorta\\n\\tsee the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session \\n\\tand got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were\\n\\toff--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).\\n\\tSo I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).\\n\\n\\tPP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer \\n\\t\"connected\" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--\\n\\tit told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it\\n\\twas _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. \\n\\tShutdown and reboot.\\n\\n\\tOk, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...\\n\\n\\tHm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let\\'s see..

Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.\\n\\tNothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.

My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:\\nAnd also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.\\n\\nThe 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX\\nsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.\\nthe 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any\\nsoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the\\ncoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the\\nactual coprocessor.\\n\\nThe internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit\\nrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance\\nboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a\\n386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and\\nQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,\\nis about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is\\naround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,\\nand DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2\\ncompatibility, but I didn't test it.\\n\\nThe 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually\\na small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains\\nthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX\\nPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board\\ndoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when \\naccess to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available\\nfrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20\\nonly.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.\\nIf Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need\\nto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...\\n\\nI also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K\\nexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still\\nsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.\\n\\nIMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or\\ncan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,\\nbut if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure\\nabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't\\nbeat it in any significant way.\\n\\nThe last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,\\nasking where I got it.

But some require VESA driver for the video cards.\\nYou don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA\\ncard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+\\ncomputers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a\\n8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write\\nsome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other\\ncolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg\\ndithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette\\nthe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would\\nwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but\\nit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way\\ngives a brighter more detailed image.\\n\\nAnyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as\\nfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the\\nVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)\\n\\nHave a day!\\n\\nGerry.\\n\",\n",

Zhao)\\nSubject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations\\nOrganization: University of Houston\\nLines: 159\\nDistribution: world\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu\\n\\n\\n   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

As you will see, the journal is structured\\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor\\'s profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\\nour common interest and job.\\n\\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \\nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\\nand on the way to become significant.

I have had\\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow\\n>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour\\n>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is\\n>sufficient interest\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)\\n\\nHere is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the\\npathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story\\nbut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the\\npotential pitfalls of \"upgrading\" to DOS 6 that I have been able to\\nnotice after only about a week of playing around with it.\\n\\nMy envorinment\\n==============\\n\\nTI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk\\nSystem BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments\\nCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel\\nAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments\\nSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-\\nWindows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs\\n\\nAfter \"updgrading\" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things\\nbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try \\'dblspace\\'.  In the\\nprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\\n\\n\\nDisk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive\\n==================================================\\n\\nWhile most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain\\napplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is\\nthat commands like \\'chkdsk\\' and \\'defrag\\' were running far too slowly to\\nconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)\\nand decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\\n\\nThe Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from\\nfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when \"upgraded\" to\\nDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of\\nmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew\\nthat DS compression must cost something.\\n\\nSpecifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually\\n*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than\\nI/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings\\nin I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large\\nrandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\\n\\nWhile the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or\\nsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on\\nWinBench\\'s assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\\n\\nThe tests alone, done in \\'real mode\\' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv\\non, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective\\nstatements like \\'there is no noticable difference in performance\\' or\\neven that \\'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and\\nslow disk I/O\\'.\\n\\nThis explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why\\n\\'chkdsk\\' and \\'defrag\\' (the latter especially) too so long.\\n\\n\\nDouble Space and Windows\\n========================\\n\\nDBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you\\nwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that\\nmatter even check on its usage -- try \"fasthelp dblspace\" in a dos box\\nwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you\\nget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\\n\\nYes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to\\nfile manager, but this \\'mstools\\' dll does not understand a compressed\\nfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed\\nfloppy if you dont know how to.)\\n\\n\\nDOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM\\n==============================================\\n\\nDefragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited\\npatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\\nThis confirmation \\'dblspace /def\\' command for the 120M drive should take\\nno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)\\nbut it took 12 minutes.\\n\\nI discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran\\nfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this\\nhad to do with TI\\'s battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)\\nmodule which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,\\nand it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After\\ndisabling the TI\\'s power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\\n\\n\\nMicrosft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots\\n====================================================================\\n\\nIn the readme.txt file, you can find the the following\\n\\n\\tRunning Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers\\n\\t----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\tTo avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup\\n\\tfor Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in\\n\\tyour CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you\\n\\trun Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.\\n\\nIf you checked TI\\'s manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it\\nmeans \"disable all power saving features of your notebook\".  Why would\\nanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only\\ndoes TI\\'s power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the\\nreadme.txt claims, but \\'chkdsk\\' and \\'dblspace\\' (and who knows what\\nelse) are crippled by the TI\\'s power saver.\\n\\nIt is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If\\nthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI\\nprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have\\nto guess as to who are the idiots.\\n\\nBy the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE\\nin DOS6, when you check the status, it says:\\n\\n\\tPower Management Status\\n\\t-----------------------\\n\\tSetting =  ADV: MAX\\n\\tCPU: idle 60% of time.\\n\\nThis figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook\\nwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in\\niconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all\\nfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is\\nsuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating\\nsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%\\nidle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type\\nof package that I like my students to study as the classical \\'negative\\'\\nexample of our times!\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft programmers do not know batch programming\\n===================================================\\n\\nI like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of\\naddpath statements like this:\\n\\n\\tset PATH=C:\\\\DOS\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=C:\\\\ETC\\\\BIN;%PATH%;C:\\\\BIN\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=C:\\\\ETC\\\\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\\\\WINDOWS\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\\\BCC\\\\BIN\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\\n\\nEven though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old\\none (i.e. c:\\\\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every\\npath statement, and prepends C:\\\\DOS to its value.  As a result, my\\nresultant path has so many DOS\\'s.\\n\\nIf the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add\\nthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement\\ncontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\\n(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a\\ndirectory different from the old one being \\'upgraded\\'.)\\n\\nInstead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)\\ndecided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and\\nprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it\\nwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\\n\\nI started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft\\nrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he\\nspecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the\\ninformation to him as he did not have access to internet.\\n\\nNow that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement\\nwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement\\nshould not be touched for any reason?\\n\\nAs another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to\\nunderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:\\n\\n\\tset MOUSE=C:\\\\ETC\\\\MOUSE\\n\\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\\n\\tloadhigh %MOUSE%\\\\MOUSE.COM\\n\\nGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with\\n\\n\\tLH ... C:\\\\ETC\\\\MOUSE\\\\MOUSE.COM\\n\\nWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its\\nparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\\n\\n\\nDOS 6 Software Quality\\n======================\\n\\nDOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,\\nyou end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the\\ncommands that come with it.\\n\\nI am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to\\nuse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont\\nwithin a week, I will post how you can create this \"ghost\" file.\\n\\nSurely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a\\nparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)\\nprogrammers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find\\nit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft \"tests the quality\" of\\ntheir products.\\n\\nI think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to \"test quality\"\\nwhen it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but\\ncan only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any\\nform of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs\\nthat will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond\\nrepair!\\n\\nAlso, if you run \\'dblspace /def\\' often enough, repeatedly when the disk\\nis fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the\\ndefragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated\\nwhen I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive\\ndefragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and\\nwith no new file creation since.\\n\\nMicrosft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you\\nadmit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we\\nshould watch out for if we have already used DS.\\n\\nJaya\\n\\n--\\nDr. Jayasooriah  CSE, CS&E, UNSW | Sign in a Paris hotel:                    \\nP.O.

My\\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\\n\\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\\nexplanation.\\n\\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\\n\"Something\\'s happening here, please take note.\" How the CPU is\\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\\nIn MS-DOS, the \"interrupt vector\" is used to store the address of the\\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\\n\\nNow, basic DOS doesn\\'t care whether the printer reports that it\\'s ready\\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there\\'s a character there,\\nwait a while and check again.  If there\\'s not, copy a new character to\\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it\\'s\\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \\n\\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\\napproach just doesn\\'t work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\\ncycles.) Hence, you can\\'t \"share\" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you\\'re\\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\\n\\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\\nneeded.\\n\\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\\n\\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\n-- \\n               Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi\\n              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls\\n           \"Trust me, I know what I\\'m doing.\" - Sledge Hammer\\n',\n",

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Actually, after reading this group, I\\'m surprised that they even\\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\\n\\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\\nthat I\\'m primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \\n\\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!

Photostyler will page to disk with\\nmedium size images.\\n\\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \\non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \\nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\\nmake a difference?

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nBravo!\\n\\n(Note to IBM\\'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so I\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n\\n-- \\n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\\n  Austin TX\\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\\n',\n",

In a recent\\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\\nsaid:\\n\\n  \"There\\'s nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90\\'s.\"\\n\\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the \"cracker\" ethic, which is something\\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \\n\\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\\n\\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\\ncomputer industry?\\n\\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\\n\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n',\n",

Please tell!\\n\\nI have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good\\nsuccess in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of\\npeople cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command\\n(a truely gnarly hack), but don\\'t believe them.  You also will hear\\npeople saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in\\nMicrosoft\\'s Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:\\n\\n  \"JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if\\n  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for\\n  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives\\n  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use\\n  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.\"\\n\\nWithin this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I\\nhave found a couple of applications that don\\'t deal well with filesystems\\nthat have been \"mounted\" using join.\\n\\nIn particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very\\nconfused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It\\nwants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then\\ndelete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.\\n\\nUnfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic\\nplace other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the\\njoined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original\\n*.doc file, it can\\'t find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you\\nsearch your disk systems, the document is gone.\\n\\nI have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box\\nwhen JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\\\\temp with a 4meg\\nramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an \"ls\" on the c:\\\\temp\\ndir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to \\nreproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think\\nthis is a Windows problem, rather than MKS\\'s, since it works OK under raw\\nDOS.\\n\\nSo, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not\\nbe as robust you would like.\\n\\nWouldn\\'t it be real great to \"mount\" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main\\nfile tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,\\nJOIN won\\'t let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch\\nto let JOIN work on network drives, but I don\\'t remember the source.\\n\\nIt\\'s too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would\\navoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was\\nmeant for casual, even ignorant users, so \"mounting\" all the drives in\\none file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry\\nthis over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant \\nusers -- NOT!).

I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the\\npowerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a\\ndifference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus\\nany other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed\\nby apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.\\n\\nI also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem\\nallowing speeds just as any other serial port.\\n\\nMy particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to\\ninterface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. \\nCurrently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything\\nup just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.\\n\\nCan anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  \\nI would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.\\nI will post a summary if enough response is generated.\\n\\nThanks. \\n\\nFaisal M. Bhamani\\nfaceman@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu\\n\\nps. If this topic has been discussed already, please excuse me and\\ndirect me to the appropriate places. thanks.\\n\",\n",

While each device is seeking the data the\\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\\n\\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\\nthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other\\nprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.\\n\\n> \\n> Also, I\\'m still trying to track down a copy of IBM\\'s AT reference book,\\n> but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):\\n> \\n> \"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board\\n> direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.\"\\n> I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  \\n> So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT\\n> HDD controller doesn\\'t!?!?

At the moment the main fora\\nfor such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither\\nof which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the\\ngeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government and\\nnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted \\nto publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,\\nand ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.\\n \\nThe reason for the division into three groups is a natural\\npartition of interest between the hardware and software topics,\\nand between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext\\nand multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, \\nPhoto CD and other related formats would be included as well. \\nTopics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly\\nhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and\\nother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in\\nthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other\\nnonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom\\npublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.\\n \\nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as\\nindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom\\nsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging\\nsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,\\nencryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.\\n \\nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that\\naids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and\\nvideo.\\n \\nThe main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that\\nrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,\\nsuch as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as\\ninformation that publishers need to know about the hardware that\\nthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will\\neventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.\\n \\nNotes\\n-----\\nThese groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or\\nquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or\\nquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.\\nRequests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general\\ntopics should be directed to other fora.

I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\\n5.1.\\n\\nOpen questions:\\n    (1) Why does this happen?\\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  Something else?\\n    (2) What to do about it?\\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\\n\\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\\n\\n-- \\n===============================================================================\\nDave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com\\nApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com\\nAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen\\n',\n",

But again it will not increase the speed\\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\\n\\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\\n\\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop\\naround as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for\\na particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.\\n\\nLawrence Khoo\\n\\n-- \\nkhoo@husc3.harvard.edu       Lawrence Khoo       Computer Consultant\\nkhoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu    (617) 496-8992    Econ.

You can use any\\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\\n\\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\\n1604s).\\n\\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would\\nadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As\\nto the comment by the person who said don\\'t bother calling Apple because\\nthey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.\\n    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN\\nCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU\\nTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND\\nTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.\\n\\npersonal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers\\ndoesn\\'t see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to\\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably\\npriced \"oder eater\" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an\\nultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz\\nvertical.\")\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video\\nboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the\\nsides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as\\npossible.

My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable\\n: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors\\n: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, \\n: the new hard drive\\'s manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable\\n: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But\\n: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug\\n: in the cable to align these.  \\n\\nMost IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed\\ncircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your\\nIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in\\nthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle\\nis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide\\npositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:\\nlook into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On\\nall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin\\nis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard\\nfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins\\n39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep\\nthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don\\'t even have to look at the\\ncable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the\\npin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But\\nbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables\\nwith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors\\nthis doesn\\'t matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide\\nwhich side is pin 1.\\n\\n: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.\\n: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into\\n: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the \"master\" drive\\n: and which into the \"Slave\"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives\\nare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you\\nshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the\\ndrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper\\nselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the \\ndocuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,\\nthen just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have\\none.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like\\nyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.

The user site can enter their\\nsite-specific \"batch profile\" into a dataset within our product, specifying\\nthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,\\netc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is\\nwritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and\\nrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as\\nthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the\\ninteractive session.\\n\\nAs currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80\\ncharacters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in\\nbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a\\nproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.\\nMVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single\\ncommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is\\n*STANDARD* with OS/2).\\n\\nThe gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not\\nwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.\\nSince my first posting I\\'ve learned that there are several third party\\ncompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.\\nAnd I\\'m sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative\\nscript language if they had it, but I can\\'t develop under the assumption\\nthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.\\n\\nI saw another post on this list (the subject was something like \"Is vi\\navailable for Windows?\") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and\\n***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is\\nit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I\\ncould count on it at all NT sites.\\n\\nOne last question:  I\\'ve heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,\\ni.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run\\nthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific\\ncommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment\\non these commands, I would appreciate it.\\n\\nThanks again for the help,\\n\\n--\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nScott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.\\nIntegrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414\\nsasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \\nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \\nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \\nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \\nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \\nvalue.  Genoa\\'s advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \\nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \\npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \\nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \\nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \\nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins \\nare available on Genoa\\'s BBS at (408) 943-1231.\\n        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \\ngraphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for \\nIBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two \\nyear limited warranty on parts and labor.

I\\'m glad we (MS) are starting\\nto remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future \\nreleases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the \\nmid-late 80\\'s, MS\\'s point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over\\nthe world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS\\n(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.\\nThe theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people\\nuntil they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the \\nwayside.\\n\\nThen Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to\\nbe doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either\\nstayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that\\npoint in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the\\nshort term and Windows/NT in the long term.

Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1\\nno longer has a \"real mode\".\\n\\nThe ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows\\nclipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added\\nby IBM to \"Win-OS/2\".\\n\\nNow, everybody who is running \"Windows\" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2\\n2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running \"Win-OS/2\" under OS/2,\\nraise YOUR hand.\\n\\nGet the picture, Cliff?\\n\\n----\\nMike Dahmus                 Internet: miked@vnet.ibm.com  Vnet: MDAHMUS at BOCA\\nPenPM Development           IBM IPNet: mike@schleppo.bocaraton.ibm.com\\nIBM Personal Systems        Disclaimer: Not an official IBM spokesman\\n',\n",
